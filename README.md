# Automated Validation System for Python Code Completions Generated by LLMs

It is a Python-based command-line tool that monitors changes to Python files in a specified directory and automatically analyzes those changes with integrated static analysis tools such as flake8, pylint, mypy, and bandit. It is particularly useful for working with code that is automatically generated by large language models (LLMs) such as GitHub Copilot.

## Features

- Monitor Python files in a specified directory for changes in real-time.
- Automatically invoke static analysis tools such as flake8, pylint, mypy, and bandit.
- Perform accurate analysis based on the lines of code that have changed, focusing on AI-generated code.
- Supports Windows 11, macOS, and Ubuntu operating systems.

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine. You can check your current Python version by running `python --version`.

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HanchengZuo/CodeWatchdog.git
   ```
2. Locate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CodeWatchdog
   ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to use

To start the monitor, specify the directory path to monitor:
```bash
python main.py <directory_to_watch>
```
Replace `<directory_to_watch>` with the directory you want to monitor.

Please save the file immediately after you get the AI-generated code so that the tool can detect the changed code.

## FAQ

**Q: How do I stop the monitoring?**

A: The monitor runs in a command line window. You can safely stop the monitoring by using `Ctrl+C` on the command line.

**Q: What types of code analysis are supported?**

A: Currently supported are flake8, pylint, mypy, and bandit. These tools cover code style checking, error detection, type checking, and security analysis.
